# Resolver - Embrace the Chance

Welcome to Resolver, a fun and interactive tool that helps you make decisions in an entertaining way. Are you stuck at a crossroads? Can't decide where to have dinner? Or perhaps, torn between two movies for the night? Don't worry, Resolver is here to add a bit of random joy to your life.

## How It Works

Resolver allows you to input any number of options, each marked either as regular or favourable. Regular options are pretty straightforward, they're just part of the pool. Favourable options, however, have a special place in your heart. Resolver takes note of this and gives these options a bit of a boost when it's crunch time.

Once all your options are in, hit the big orange "Resolve!" button and let Resolver work its magic. It will randomly pick an option for you, taking into account the weight of favourable options. The result? A fun and fair way to make a decision!

## Fun with Limits

To keep things interesting, Resolver adds a twist. Once you've hit the "Resolve!" button, you'll have to wait a bit before you can resolve again. This cooldown period brings a little more weight to the decision, making the process more thrilling.

## A Personal Project

Resolver is a personal project built with the idea of making decisions a bit more enjoyable and less stressful. Feel free to use it, share it, and let chance guide some of your choices. Who knows, you might just discover something new and exciting!
